              <b class="d-block">Introduction :</b>
              I am Osama Shawar, Access 17 Student. This a page is for a project
              fo the book that the student read and my book was When Zakary
              Beaver Came To Town
            </p>
            <div class="summary">
              <p>
                <b class="d-block">Sections of website</b>
                I made this website for 2 things :
                <var class="d-block"
                  >First thing its a creative idea to make a website that
                  includes a game of the project ( facts guessing from the event
                  )</var
                >
                <var class="d-block"
                  >Second thing is to make for the teacher or students easier to
                  see the Project, Report, Summary, and the characters
                </var>
              </p>
              <p>
                <b class="d-block">Characters</b>
                It shows us a table which includes the name of the character,
                the age, and a simple description of him/her.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b class="d-block">Summary</b>
                Summary includes my summary for each 2 chapters.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b class="d-block">Report</b>
                Its a form i filled it which includes all of the important ideas
                that the story talks about and talks about where, when, why.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b class="d-block">Project</b>
                The project section is the thing that why i made the website its
                a beautiful idea to play, conclude, define, and enjoy with the
                facts in the story
              </p>
              <p>
                <b class="d-block">Facts</b>
                This Section is allowed for the teacher only because the facts
                which are in this section is for letting the student conclude
                the fact from the event, so if students saw them the project
                will not work. I made it if the teacher wanna take a look into
                the facts.
