            When Zakary Beaver Came To Town Summary
          </h1>
          <p>
            <b class="chapter">Chapter (1 + 2) :</b>
            Zakary Beaver is the toughest person in the world. He weighs around
            643 pounds (291 kg). He came in a trailer which was carried by a
            Thunderbird (a simple, small car), so all of the citizens of Antler,
            Texas, came to see what was happening.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="chapter">Chapter (3 + 4) :</b>
            It talks about Toby’s (the main character) life. He lives with his
            father in an old house without his mother, because she left him with
            his father and traveled to Nashville in Tennessee, also known as
            “Music City.” Another day shows how he plays with his best friend,
            Cal.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="chapter">Chapter (5 + 6) :</b>
            It talks about the curiosity of Toby and Cal. They went to the
            library of Antler to see if Zakary Beaver really was the toughest
            person. They read that the toughest person weighed 739 pounds, but
            Zakary had 643 pounds. Miss Myrtie Mae (a character) saw them and
            told them to let Zakary show himself without any judgment. Zakary’s
            friend, Paulie Rankin, left Antler and Zakary was alone, so Toby and
            Cal had a new mission: to visit Zakary and give him some food. They
            brought vegetables from Toby’s father’s farm and meals made by Cal’s
            hands.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="chapter">Chapter (7 + 8) :</b>
            It starts when they got Zakary some food from the market. When they
            went near Zakary’s trailer, some younger children (Mayson and some
            of his friends) came and started bullying him, that shows not of all
            the children are respectful. Toby also heard that his mother didn’t
            win in the singing competition. Toby became sad for her, but at the
            same time happy, because she had finished the competitions and would
            return home.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="chapter">Chapter (9 + 10) :</b>
            Toby found a new job mowing grass. He woke up excited to start.
            After coming back home from a tiring day, he decided to surprise
            Scarlet with a German chocolate cake. He took a shower, then gave it
            to her. Scarlet was happy, and Toby felt loved.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="chapter">Chapter (11 + 12) :</b>
            They surprised Zakary Beaver with a chocolate cake to make him their
            friend and to build a relationship between him and the other people
            in Antler. But the problem was that the people asked Zakary some
            personal questions about his family, which annoyed him, since his
            mother was dead.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="chapter">Chapter (13 + 14) :</b>
            Toby and Cal planned a trip with Zakary to the cinema. At first,
            Zakary refused angrily, so they asked Malcom’s brother ( Kitt )to
            convince him, and he succeeded. They went to the cinema to make
            Zakary as happy as possible. After that, Toby and Cal started
            talking about “Baptism,” a Christian religious rite. They explained
            that baptism gives a person a new start in life and faith, and makes
            them an important member of the Christian community.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="chapter">Chapter (15 + 16) :</b>
            Toby’s father called a reverend, Newton (around 45 years old), to
            explain baptism and its importance. Newton told him old stories,
            like how he was once a thief but, after baptism, became respected in
            Antler. Later, news came that Wayne (Cal’s brother) had died in the
            Vietnam War (since the story takes place in 1971). Antler became
            very depressed after this.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="chapter">Chapter (17 + 18) :</b>
            Toby wanted to give Scarlet a gift, so he gave her an expensive ring
            that had belonged to his mother. He was happy, but stressed, because
            it was the last thing his mother had left before leaving. After a
            few days, Toby asked Scarlet to return the ring, and she agreed.
            Toby became even more depressed after Wayne’s death. He didn’t go to
            Wayne’s funeral. After work at the restaurant, he unexpectedly met
            Juan. Juan was sad because Scarlet was ignoring his calls, messages,
            and gifts. Toby helped him by planning a surprise. He blindfolded
            Scarlet with a scarf and took her on his bicycle. When he removed
            the scarf, she saw Juan—but ignored him. Instead, she told Toby:
            “You are my best friend. I love you.”
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="chapter">Chapter (19 + 20) :</b>
            Toby’s father treated him to a fishing trip, since it was his
            father’s old job. Toby didn’t enjoy it, because he was thinking
            about his mother, Zakary’s baptism, and many other worries. Zakary
            was also stressed, because baptism was his biggest dream. Toby asked
            a restaurant friend to help baptize Zakary without going to church,
            since Zakary’s huge weight made it impossible.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="chapter">Chapter (21 + 22) :</b>
            It was time for Zakary’s baptism in a lake. Cal and Kitt came to
            help Toby. The truck broke down, but some people helped them reach
            the lake. Zakary went into the water and was baptized. He was very
            happy, because it was his biggest dream. Lifting him out was
            difficult, but they managed. The next day, Zakary prepared to leave
            Antler. Miss Myrtie took a photo as a souvenir of that exciting
            summer. Zakary was grateful that his dream had come true. Toby and
            Cal watched sadly as the Thunderbird carried Zakary out of Antler.
            He promised to send them letters.
